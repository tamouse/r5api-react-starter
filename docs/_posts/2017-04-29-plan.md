Step by step, from a basic initial set up, create a React SPA
blogging platform (of course), using the Rails server as an API
**only**. The only page that will be built and sent will be the basic
app page that will load the React App component. Everything else,
including styles, scripts, images, etc., i.e., all the bits of a
user-facing web app, will be handled via webpacker.

Along the way, I'll include user signup, login, and authentication
using JSON Web Tokens. I'll be making use of the `localStorage` API
to keep track of the app token the server will be providing the
client.



## Testing

Just a word about testing: most of the time, the things I'm
learning about I just implement without focusing on how I would
test these in an actual application. I want to break that habit
here, and figure out how to do real application testing in both
halves of this, the Rails API server, and the React SPA. It will
be interesting to run both of these.

I've got guard set up on the Rails side, that should be pretty
nice. Selenium is included in the kit, but I'd prefer to use Jest
on the client side to make testing more fun, fast, and lighter
weight, saving the full integration stuff where it's truly needed.
