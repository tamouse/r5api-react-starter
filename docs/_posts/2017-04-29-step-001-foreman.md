New Rails 5.1 apps built with webpack need to have two server-type
processes running during development:

1.  the usual rails server
2.  webpack-dev-server, which is serving up the webpacked components,
    hot refreshing them as they're developed.

To manage this, we're installing [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman), which can run concurrent
processes specified in a `Procfile`.
