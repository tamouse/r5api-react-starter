Install, configure, and create some Jest tests.

Discovery: configuring Jest is not straight-forward for this app!

See: <http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/configuration.html>

    "jest": {
      "rootDir": "app/javascript/packs/",
      "moduleFileExtensions": ["js", "jsx"],
      "moduleDirectories": ["node_modules", "app/javascript/packs"]
    }

Set the `rootDir` to 'app/javascript/packs' tells Jest to look
there for application tests.

I'm not sure what `moduleDirectories` is adding here, but it seems
to work.

**IMPORTANT!** Test files must follow the pattern: `*.test.js?(x)` in
order to be found by Jest &#x2013; a **dot** instead of an **underscore** as
in minitest!! I could probably get around this difference, but I'm
not going to bother to figure it out.
