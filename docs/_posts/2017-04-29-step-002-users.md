Add a users resource to the project.

This will be used as a basis for building authentication.

-   uncomment the `bcrypt` gem, since we'll need it to secure the
    user's password in the database
-   make a User model that includes:
    -   username, unique, non-null, lowercase only
    -   email, unique, non-null, lowercase only
    -   password<sub>digest</sub>, non-null
    -   admin, boolean, false, non-null
    -   `has_secure_password`
-   write tests
