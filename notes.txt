* Rails 5 API-based application with webpack and react

Created with: ~rails new r5api-react-starter --no-rc --webpack=react~

** step-001/foreman

New Rails 5.1 apps built with webpack need to have two server-type
processes running during development:

1. the usual rails server
2. webpack-dev-server, which is serving up the webpacked components,
   hot refreshing them as they're developed.

To manage this, we're installing [[https://github.com/ddollar/foreman][foreman]], which can run concurrent
processes specified in a ~Procfile~.
