* Rails 5 API-based application with webpack and react

Created with: ~rails new r5api-react-starter --no-rc --webpack=react~

** step-001/foreman

New Rails 5.1 apps built with webpack need to have two server-type
processes running during development:

1. the usual rails server
2. webpack-dev-server, which is serving up the webpacked components,
   hot refreshing them as they're developed.

To manage this, we're installing [[https://github.com/ddollar/foreman][foreman]], which can run concurrent
processes specified in a ~Procfile~.

   Add a users resource to the project.

   This will be used as a basis for building authentication.

   - uncomment the ~bcrypt~ gem, since we'll need it to secure the
     user's password in the database
   - make a User model that includes:
     - username, unique, non-null, lowercase only
     - email, unique, non-null, lowercase only
     - password_digest, non-null
     - admin, boolean, false, non-null
     - ~has_secure_password~
   - write tests

   Adding in some tools:
   - pry-rails
